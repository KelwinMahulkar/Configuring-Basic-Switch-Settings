# Configuring-Basic-Switch-Settings
This project activity is similar to a previously uploaded project but their are many differences though. 

The displaying of MAC Addresses, dynamic and assigning a static MAC address to the port. Clearing dynamic MAC addresses. 

In one of the steps even after clearing the MAC address table, it can be seen that still there is an entry for the address which was initially seen before clearing out the MAC address table. This is because there are still some applications running in the PC which may have sent frames to the switch which is why the address entry is still there. 

**A document file has been uploaded with the project** in which all the observations and changes have been documented.
